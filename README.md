Pank
====

Why the name?
-------------
Comes from Python + Bank, an idea to use Python's data manipulation and plotting capabilities to analyse and classify bank transactions in a csv file.

Purpose
-------
Where I live sites such as https://www.mint.com/ can not be used, but I find myself wanting to know where my money is spent, and want to see different forms of representation for it.

This is only intended to be (for now) a personal project, which serves me as a means to learn Python + Numpy + Pandas!
